ROLES
http://en.support.wordpress.com/user-roles/
The minimun role to moderate comments is Editor. 
The other role with this ability is Administrator, but only one per blog is recommended.
Also, it won't be nice for the clients to add an extra administrator.

The API can only check if you are an admin!
Be sure that you are trying to moderate admin or editor blogs.

Your XML-RPC server/path are as described here:
    * If your WordPress root is http://example.com/wordpress/, then you have:
          o Server: http://example.com/ (some tools will just want the 'example.com' hostname part)
          o Path: /wordpress/xmlrpc.php
          o complete URL (just in case): http://example.com/wordpress/xmlrpc.php 

Comment removed when moderated are set as spam!
