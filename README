A Java SDK for WordPress.

A client needed to add WordPress support to his content moderation platform, with both pre and post moderation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For blogs that are hosted on Wordpress.com, you need to create an account there.
For custom Wordpress installations, create an account there or ask the admin to create one for you.

ROLES (http://en.support.wordpress.com/user-roles/)
The minimun role to moderate comments is Editor.
The other role with this ability is Administrator, but only one per blog is recommended.
Also, it won't be nice for the clients to add an extra administrator.
The blog's admin needs to add your user as an editor of the blog.

PERMISSIONS
The API can't check if you have sufficient privileges!
Be sure that you are trying to moderate being admin or editor.
If you don't have sufficient privileges an exception is thrown.

URL (Usage with your custom wordpress installations)
Your XML-RPC server/path are as described here:
    * If your WordPress root is http://example.com/wordpress/, then you have:
          o Server: http://example.com/ (some tools will just want the 'example.com' hostname part)
          o Path: /wordpress/xmlrpc.php
          o complete URL (just in case): http://example.com/wordpress/xmlrpc.php 

Comments set as spam are moved to the spam sections of Wordpress backoffice.
Comments deleted are moved to the trash sections of Wordpress backoffice.

Pre and post moderation
Go to: Settings->Discussions->Before a comment appears
Check or uncheck this:  "An administrator must always approve the comment"

Dates must be in GMT/UTC to coordinate with Wordpress servers.
